                        <h1>Operating System</h1>
                        <p>An operating system is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a vital component of the system software in a computer system.</p>

                  <div class="subject-container-div">
                        <h1>System Software</h1>
                        <p>System software is a type of compter program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs. If we think of the computer system as a layered model, the system software is the interface between the hardware and user applications. The operating system is the best-known example of system software.</p>
                        <p>They are written in low-level assembly language or machine code. Also, they are installed at the same time as OS, usually by the manufacturer. They run any time the computer is on.</p>
                        <p>System software includes operating systems, device drivers and utility softwares. They are necessary for system to function.</p>

                        <h1>Device Driver</h1>
                        <p>A device driver is a computer program that operates a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. A driver provides software interface to hardware devices.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="subject-container-div">
                        <h1>Utility Software</h1>
                        <p>Utility software is a type of software that is designed to analyze, configure, optimize and maintain a computer. It is used to support the computer infrastructure. Anti-viruses, debuggers, system diagnostic programs, package managers, system monitors are some examples to utility software.</p>

                        <h1>Booting</h1>
                        <p>Booting is the process of powering on a computer and getting into the operating system. If th ecomputer is in working condition, it boots automatically after turning on the computer. If problems exist that prevent the computer from booting, an error message will be shown on the monitor.</p>
                        <p>During the boot process, the computer goes through multiple steps to ensure the computer hardware works correctly and the necessary software can be loaded. In the booting phase, the computer performs the following tasks.</p>
                        <p>1. Pressing the power button on the computer starts up the power supply unit (PSU), which provides power to the hardware components of the computer.</p>
                        <p>2. A self diagnostic is performed, also known as a POST (Power On Self Test), to check if all hardware in the computer is attached and working properly.</p>
                        <p>3. The BIOS checks the hard drive for the boot loader, located in the first sector of the hard drive.</p>
                        <p>4. The boot loader looks for the operating system on the hard drive and begins loading the found operating system (FreeBSD, Ubuntu, Debian, macOS, Windows...).</p>
                        <p>5. Hardware drivers are loaded, allowing the operating system to interact the hardware components inside the computer.</p>
                        <p>6. A login screen will be displayed if it is configured. And it will ask for username and password to log in.</p>
                        <p>7. Any additional software programs configured to start with the operating system will start (Startup Programs). Common startup programs include antivirus software, mail clients etc...</p>
