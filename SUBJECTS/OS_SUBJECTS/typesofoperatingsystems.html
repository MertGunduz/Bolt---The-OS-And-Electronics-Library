                        <h1>Batch Operating System</h1>
                        <p>Batch Operating System does not interact with the computer directly. There is an operator which takes similar jobs having the same requirement and group them into batches. It is the responsibility of the operator to sort jobs with similar needs.</p>
                        <p>Operator has to deallocate the resources first, and has to allocate the resources if the job is different than the previous job.</p>
                        <p>Batch operating systems are good for processing the same task repeatedly.</p>

                        <h1>Time Sharing (Multitasking) Operating Systems</h1>
                        <p>Each task is given some time to execute so that all the tasks work smoothly. Each user gets the time of CPU as the use a single system. These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. The task can be from a single user or different users also. The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum. After this time interval is over OS switches over to the next task.</p>
                        <p>Time Sharing (Multitasking) Operating Systems gives each task equal opportunity. Also, this architecture reduces the CPU idle time.</p>
                        <p>This type of operating system enables many people, located at various terminals, to use a particular computer system at the same time.</p>
                        <p>The main difference between <strong>Multiprogrammed Batch Systems</strong> and <strong>Time-Sharing Sysems</strong> is that in case of Multiprogrammed batch systems, the objective is to maximize processor use, whereas in Time-Sharing Systems, the objective is to minimize response time. </p>

                        <h1>Distributed Operating System</h1>
                        <p>These types of operating system is a recent advancement in the world of computer technology and are being widely accepted all over the world. Various autonomous interconnected computers communicate with each other using a shared communication network.</p>

                        <h1>Network Operating System</h1>
                        <p>A network operating system runs on a server and provides the server the capability to manage data, users, groups, security applications, and other networking functions. The primary purpose of network operating system is to allow shared file and printer access among multiple computers in a networ, typically a local area network.</p>
                        <p>Examples of network operating systems include Microsoft Windows Server, UNIX, Linux, macOS X, Novell Netware and BSD.</p>

                        <h1>Real Time Operating System</h1>
                        <p>Real time operating systems provide real-time systems. The time interval required to process and respond to inputs are very small. This time interval is called response time.</p>
                        <p>This type operating systems are used when there are time requirements that are very strict like missile systems, air traffic control systems, robots, spaceships etc...</p>
